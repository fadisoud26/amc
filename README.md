1. Project Idea and Objective
This project presents a mobile application specifically designed for the patients and visitors of Alwadi Medical Center, allowing them to benefit from many of the services the center provides with ease, clarity, and at any time, from anywhere, without needing to visit the center in person.

The application is available to users who have previously registered an account, allowing them to explore all departments and clinics‚Äîmedical and cosmetic‚Äîwithin the center. Users can get to know the most prominent doctors, nurses, and the full medical team, as well as the latest devices and technologies being used. It also showcases the most notable ongoing offers, medical instructions, and procedures that patients should follow. Additionally, it allows users to book suitable appointments directly through the app by providing detailed schedules for each doctor and cosmetic specialist, with the ability to modify those appointments electronically. The app also includes comprehensive explanations of the devices used, along with the latest offers and news from the center that may interest the visitors.

The project also includes a web application designed to suit the workflow of receptionists, mobile app administrators, and the center‚Äôs general manager.

Each of these roles is provided with interfaces tailored to help them perform their duties efficiently. The receptionist uses the application to register visitors, manage bookings, and handle some administrative tasks. The app administrator is responsible for managing social media communications and handling the addition, deletion, and editing of data related to doctors, devices, services, offers, and medical instructions available at the center. The general manager is provided with a dashboard to monitor the workflow and access feedback submitted by visitors to ensure their satisfaction and verify the quality of services.

In addition to the various services available to both the medical staff and patients, what distinguishes this application is its role in reducing peak hours, minimizing crowding and scheduling conflicts, and saving time.

Patients of the medical and cosmetic clinics can also provide feedback and rate the quality of services after receiving them. Patient evaluations are essential in highlighting the center‚Äôs weaknesses for internal improvement and showcasing its strengths to increase trust and enhance the quality and consistency of services.

This application serves as an effective and essential tool to simplify the experience of visitors and meet their needs‚Äîwhich may sometimes be hard to achieve‚Äîthrough a simple, user-friendly interface that mimics real-life interactions.


2. Importance of the Project
The importance of the Alwadi Medical Center System lies in its ability to achieve the following:

Easy account registration through the mobile app and seamless navigation through the center‚Äôs departments without complications.

User-friendly interfaces that are easy to understand and do not require many steps or procedures for the user to reach what they need.

Availability of the application in both Arabic and English, allowing users from different cultures and language backgrounds to interact with it.

Support for both Light Mode and Dark Mode, each offering advantages such as eye protection, energy saving, content clarity, and theme customization based on user preferences.

Well-organized appointment management, reducing chaos, simplifying tracking, and minimizing human errors during the booking process.

Creative and attractive presentation of offers and promotional posts, grabbing users' attention and encouraging them to share them, thereby spreading awareness about the center and increasing its reach.

Boosting patient confidence by providing clear instructions and explanations regarding the devices and services available, making them more comfortable and avoiding behaviors that may negatively affect their health.

Focusing on patient experience by involving them in evaluations and using the data to develop improvement plans for the center.

Allowing the app administrator to manage and simplify administrative edits and procedures.

Performance evaluation by enabling the general manager to view weekly and monthly statistics to monitor and identify areas needing improvement.

3. Project Beneficiaries
This project benefits several groups, as it provides an app for patients and visitors to ease their communication with the center and another app for the center's staff. Staff members log into the system from different accounts, giving the receptionist, app administrator, and general manager a more organized and effective environment to carry out their respective tasks.
